Task 1 - Blocks

The code has been modified to meet specific styling and layout requirements using only Bootstrap classes, without altering the HTML structure. Here are the changes made to the code and their corresponding descriptions:

Added Bootstrap CSS Link:
Body Class Modification:
The <body> tag has a new class attribute with the value "text-white text-center". This class configuration ensures that text inside the body is centered and has white color.

Row and Column Structure:
The page content has been organized into rows and columns using Bootstrap classes for responsive grid layouts.

First Line:
Each cell within this line uses Bootstrap's grid system with classes col-12 col-lg-3 p-2 to achieve the desired layout.
bg-primary, bg-success, bg-danger, and bg-warning classes are used to set background colors for the respective cells.
The text is centered and white due to the body class configuration.

Second Line:
Similar to the first line, each cell uses Bootstrap grid classes, but the breakpoint classes have been modified to meet responsiveness requirements.
On screens wider than 576px, the cells are displayed as 4 columns in one line, while on smaller screens, they are displayed as 4 lines in one column.

Third Line:
The layout of this line differs from the previous two lines.
Each cell uses Bootstrap classes, with different column widths to achieve the desired layout.
The last cell takes 50% of the screen's width, and the middle cell is twice the size of the first cell.
The number of columns in one line depends on the screen width.

Fourth Line:
This line arranges the cells with different orders based on screen size.
Bootstrap's order classes have been added to achieve the desired order changes.
The order of cells varies depending on the screen width, following the specified rules.

Fifth Line:
In this line, each cell's width is set to approximately 16% of the screen.
The layout differs based on the screen width, displaying either 2 columns on each side of the screen or 2 lines in one column.

Last Line:
The cells in the last line have the same width, and the spacing between them is adjusted according to screen size.
On screens wider than 768px, they are displayed as 3 columns in one line, with different spacing.
On smaller screens, they are displayed as 3 lines in one column.
These Bootstrap classes and configurations ensure that the HTML elements maintain the required styling and layout as specified in the task's requirements, without any additional CSS or HTML structure changes.
